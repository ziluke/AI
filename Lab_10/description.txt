Algorithm:

-takes as inputs the temperature and the humidity
-we calculate the membership of each input value to each class of the input descriptions
-using the rules, we apply AND between the probabilities of the temperature and humidity class to obtain the 
	probability of the time class
-using the Sugeno model, we intersect the output class diagram with the straight lines from the values
	of the temperature and humidity classes, thus obtaning a value
-the weighted average is the time output for the given inputs

Calculations:

temperature: {very cold, cold, normal, warm, hot}
humidity: {dry, normal, wet}
time: {short, medium, long}

Input: temperature 17, humidity 65

we calculate the membership of the inputs:
Temparature membership: {very cold: 0, cold: 0, normal: 0.6, warm: 0.4, hot: 0}
Humidity membership: {dry: 0, normal: 0.7, wet: 0.3}

we then calculate the outputs for each rule and hold only the nonzero ones:

we get the following output values: short: 0.3; short: 0.3; medium: 0.6; medium: 0.4

after that we make the weighted average between the output values that result in the output value for the time class:
time: 44.375

Input: temperature 20, humidity 75


we calculate the membership of the inputs:
Temparature membership: {very cold: 0, cold: 0, normal: 0, warm: 1.0, hot: 0}
Humidity membership: {dry: 0, normal: 0.5, wet: 0.5}

we then calculate the outputs for each rule and hold only the nonzero ones:

we get the following output values: short: 0.5; medium: 0.5

after that we make the weighted average between the output values that result in the output value for the time class:
time: 37.5
